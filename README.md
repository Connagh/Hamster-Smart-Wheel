# Hamster-Smart-Wheel

This project utilises an arduino nano, small magnet, magnetometer, LCD panel with a light-capture pocket, housed in a self-designed hamster wheel but will work with any (please research appropriate size for your pet's species and breed). This code references an LCD panel but this is no longer recommended. Future implementations will use an e-ink or user-based augmented reality display to mitigate light pollution in the animal's enclosure.

How it works: The enclosed magnet and magnetometer count the amount of spins performed by the wheel, calculating the animal's distance travelled (circumference of the wheel times amount of spins), and displays a playful 'calories burned' using the rule of thumb that the average human person burns 100 calories per mile ran - the hamsters seemed wholly unphased by this unfair expectation, running up-to 7 miles in one night measured using the smart wheel system.

I loved working on this project while working for my founded company @CleverPetsUK and will be continuing to open-source similar projects as a heartfelt contribution to the necessary world of animal welfare.
